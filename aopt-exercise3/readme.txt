Programming Exercise: Mass Spring System

The implementation of the basic functions (eval function, gradient, hessian) wasn't difficult.
We didn't understand first what we had to do in the MassSpringSystemT_impl.hh, so we had to ask for help in the forum.
With the short explanation we could implement the setup function.
Unfortunately, one tests fails always and we didn't figure out what the problem is:
/** Compares your MSS's energy computation's results with ours */
Expected equality of these values:
  energy
    Which is: 1654.8638
  1033.1414
